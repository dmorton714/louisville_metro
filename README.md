<h1> Louisville metro salary Project </h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>This project started as grouping and graphing exercise. I wanted to graph government each department to see how spending compared. </p>
<p>Once the inital project was completed I was shocked at the variations in spending by department. I assumed they would all be a bit closer, and not as large.</p>
