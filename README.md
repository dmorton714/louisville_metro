<h1> Louisville metro salary Project </h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>This project started as grouping and graphing exercise. I wanted to graph government each department to see how spending compared. </p>
<p>Once the inital project was completed I was shocked at the variations in spending by department. I assumed they would all be a bit closer, and not as large.</p>

</p>
<p> After seeing the large variance deference LMPD, Fire, and Corrections I decided to dig into the employee salaries. I then ran some equations and querys to gain insight from the data. I had determined many of the employees where making more in over time pay than their annual salaries. Which prompted querys on employees with the highest deviations in pay to over time pay. </p>
